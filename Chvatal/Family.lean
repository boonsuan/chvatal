# Finite set families and maximal intersection

This file formalizes the set-family language used in Sections 1 and 4 of
*A proof of Chvátal's conjecture via a sharp correlation inequality*.
In particular, `Family.isMaximalIntersecting_iff` and
`Family.IsMaximalIntersecting.card_eq` give Proposition 4.1. We use mathlib's
`Set.Intersecting`, `IsUpperSet`, and `IsLowerSet`, so intersection includes a
member paired with itself: the empty set cannot belong to an intersecting family.

The dimension-zero exception is explicit. The empty family is maximal
intersecting on an empty ground type, but is not antipodal. Accordingly,
Proposition 4.1 is stated for a nonempty ground type.
